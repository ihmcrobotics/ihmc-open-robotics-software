The model is subdivision ready.
This is just the base mesh,
Use a subdivision surface to get smother geometry.

I use the spec gloss texture work flow and i have added those textures. 
The texture files were created in substance painter but later modified in Photoshop.
Creating new textures will be a long process for another texture workflow.
Look online if you want to use the spec gloss workflow. It is quite simple.

If you like the model please do leave a like or comment on the model.

Feel free to use the model if you want but please "Do mention my name if you use it".
Thnx for reading.
