/**
 * The {@code SelectionMatrix6D} provides a simple way to define for a given application what are
 * the axes of interest for spatial data consisting of an angular part and a linear part.
 * <p>
 * Given the set of axes of interest and a reference frame to which these axes refer to, the
 * {@code SelectionMatrix6D} is then able compute the corresponding 6-by-6 selection matrix:<br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * S = / A<sub>3x3</sub> <b>0</b><sub>3x3</sub> \
 *     \ <b>0</b><sub>3x3</sub> L<sub>3x3</sub> /
 * </pre>
 * 
 * where <b>0</b><sub>3x3</sub> is the 3-by3 zero matrix, A<sub>3x3</sub> is the 3-by-3 selection
 * matrix for the angular part, and L<sub>3x3</sub> is the 3-by-3 selection matrix for the linear
 * part.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The principal use-case is for the controller core notably used for the walking controller. This
 * class can be used to clearly define what the axes to be controlled for a given end-effector.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the {@link #selectionFrame} is optional. It is preferable to provide it when possible,
 * but when it is absent, i.e. equal to {@code null}, the selection matrix will then be generated
 * assuming the destination frame is the same as the selection frame.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the two 3-by-3 selection matrices used by this class do not necessarily need to be
 * using the same selection frame.
