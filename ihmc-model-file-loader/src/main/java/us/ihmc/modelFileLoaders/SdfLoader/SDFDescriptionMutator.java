/**
 * This interface defines an API for tweaking the properties of elements in .SDF files at runtime.
 * Functionally, it is equivalent to performing a hand-edit on an SDF file, but does not require us
 * to maintain a manual workflow for hand-editing when we regenerate .sdf files that originate as
 * Xacro templates.
 * <p>
 * This interface does not currently define a way for making additions to a model; it simply allows
 * for modifications to the stock elements in the .xml on disk.
 * <p>
 * As an .SDF can contain multiple models (vehicles, robots, obstacles, etc.) all of the mutation
 * methods take in a model name argument, passing on which model the joint or link belongs to. This
 * information should be checked by implementing classes to be future-proof for loading of
 * multi-model simulation descriptions.
