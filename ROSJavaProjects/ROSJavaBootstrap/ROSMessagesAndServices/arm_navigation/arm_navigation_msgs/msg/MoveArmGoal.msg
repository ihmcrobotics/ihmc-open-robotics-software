# A planning scene diff

# A motion planning request
MotionPlanRequest motion_plan_request

# OPTIONAL: Diff uses ordered collision operations in addition to allowed_collision_matrix
arm_navigation_msgs/OrderedCollisionOperations operations

# OPTIONAL flag
# Setting this flag to true will allow move_arm to accept plans that do not go all the way to the goal
bool accept_partial_plans

# OPTIONAL flag
# Setting this flag to true will allow move_arm to accept invalid goals
# This is useful if you are using a planner like CHOMP along with a noisy rapidly changing collision map
# and you would like to plan to a goal near an object.
bool accept_invalid_goals

# OPTIONAL flag
# Setting this flag to true will disable the call to IK for a pose goal
bool disable_ik

# OPTIONAL flag
# Setting this flag to true will disable collision monitoring during execution of a trajectory
