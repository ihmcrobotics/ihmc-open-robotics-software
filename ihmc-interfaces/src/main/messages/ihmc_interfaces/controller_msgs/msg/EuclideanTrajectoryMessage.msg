# This message is part of the IHMC whole-body controller API.
# This message carries the information to execute a trajectory in taskspace (position only) by defining trajectory points.
# A third order polynomial function is used to interpolate positions.
# To execute a single straight line trajectory to reach a desired position, set only one trajectory point with zero velocity and its time to be equal to the desired trajectory time.

# Unique ID used to identify this message, should preferably be consecutively increasing.

# List of trajectory points (in taskpsace) to go through while executing the trajectory.
