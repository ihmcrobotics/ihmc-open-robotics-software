# Time in nanoseconds of the clock hanging on the wall.
# Takes into account leap seconds/years and is updated by the NTP server (thus can jump backwards).
# The wall time is usually used in ROS1 for synchronizing timestamps of different time sources (computers, sensors, etc.)
int64 wall_time
# Time in nanoseconds that represents the absolute elapsed wall-clock time since some arbitrary, fixed point in the past.
# It is not affected by changes in the system time-of-day clock.
# This time is usually computed from a real-time process and can be used for reliably computing the time elapsed between two events.
int64 monotonic_time
# Platform dependent.
# Time signal in nanoseconds that can be used to synchronize two time sources.
