# When CONTROL_DURATIONS is chosen:
#   The controller will try to achieve the swing_duration and the transfer_duration specified in the message.
#   If a footstep touches down early, the next step will not be affected by this and the whole trajectory might finish earlier than expected.
# When CONTROL_ABSOLUTE_TIMINGS is chosen:
#   The controller will compute the expected times for swing start and touchdown and attempt to start a footstep at that time.
#   If a footstep touches down early, the following transfer will be extended to make up for this
#   time difference and the footstep plan will finish at the expected time.
