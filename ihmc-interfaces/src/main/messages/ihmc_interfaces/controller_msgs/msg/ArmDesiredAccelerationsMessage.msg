# This message gives the user the option to bypass IHMC feedback controllers for the arm joints by sending desired arm joint accelerations.
# One needs experience in control when activating the bypass as it can result in unexpected behaviors for unreasonable accelerations.
# A message with a unique id equals to 0 will be interpreted as invalid and will not be processed by the controller.
