# This message is part of the IHMC whole-body controller API.
# This message carries the information to execute a trajectory in taskspace (orientation only) by defining trajectory points.
# A Hermite based curve (third order) is used to interpolate the orientations.
# To execute a single straight "line" trajectory to reach a desired orientation, set only one trajectory point with zero velocity and its time to be equal to the desired trajectory time.

# Unique ID used to identify this message, should preferably be consecutively increasing.

# List of trajectory points (in taskpsace) to go through while executing the trajectory.

# This is the frame attached to the rigid body that the taskspace trajectory is defined for.
