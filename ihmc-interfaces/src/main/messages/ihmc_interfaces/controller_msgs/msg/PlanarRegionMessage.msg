# This message is part of the IHMC robot environment awareness module.
# This message contains a single planar region.
# It is defined by an origin, a normal, and a concave hull.
# For easier processing, a set of convex polygons approximating the concave hull are also provided.

# Unique ID used to identify this message, should preferably be consecutively increasing.
