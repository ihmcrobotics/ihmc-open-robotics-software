/**
 * The {@code WeightMatrix3D} provides a simple way to define weights in a particular frame, which typically make up the main diagonal of a matrix. 
 * <p>
 * Given the set of weights about particular axis of interest and a reference frame to which these axes refer to, the
 * {@code WeightMatrix3D} is then able compute the corresponding 6-by-6 weight matrix.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The principal use-case of this class is to help users define the QP weights of each axis for a given end-effector and what frame they should be 
 * expressed in. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the {@link #weightFrame} is optional. It is preferable to provide it when possible,
 * but when it is absent, i.e. equal to {@code null}, the weight matrix will then be generated
 * assuming the destination frame is the same as the weight frame.
