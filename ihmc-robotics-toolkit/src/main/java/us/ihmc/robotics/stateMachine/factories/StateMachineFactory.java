/**
 * This factory gathers convenience methods to configure and create a {@link StateMachine}.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example for creating a simple state machine that represents the main usecase of this
 * factory:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create new factory: <br>
 * {@code StateMachineFactory<StateEnum, State> factory = new StateMachineFactory<>(StateEnum.class);}
 * <li>Setup the name, registry, and clock:<br>
 * {@code factory.setNamePrefix("myStateMachine").setRegistry(myRegistry).buildYoClock(yoTime);}
 * <li>Add the states:<br>
 * {@code factory.addState(StateEnum.A, stateA).addState(StateEnum.B, stateB);}
 * <li>Add the transitions:<br>
 * {@code factory.addTransition(StateEnum.A, StateEnum.B, time -> time > timeToStayInStateA);}
 * <li>Create the state machine:<br>
 * {@code StateMachine<StateEnum, State> myStateMachine = factory.build(StateEnum.A);}
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please take a look at the factory which provides a different way of configuring a state machine:
 * {@link EventBasedStateMachineFactory}.
 * </p>
