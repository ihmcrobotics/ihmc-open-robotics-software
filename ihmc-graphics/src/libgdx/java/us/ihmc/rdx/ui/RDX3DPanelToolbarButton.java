/**
 * Icons must be PNGs and should have transparent backgrounds.
 * We expect there to be an "up", "hover", and "down" icon.
 *
 * We want to place this icons in one PNG image with the "up"
 * in the left third of the image, the "hover" in the middle,
 * and the "down" on the right. We will use UV coordinates
 * to switch between them.
 *
 * "Up" is when the button is inactive, just sitting there.
 * "Hover" is when the user merely hovers over it with the mouse.
 * "Down" is when the mouse is hovered and the left mouse button
 * is in the down position.
 *
 * It's recommended that hover casts a drop shadow about 0.5 opacity
 * and down casts the same drop shadows at 0.8 opacity.
