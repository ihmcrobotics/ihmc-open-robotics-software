/**
 * Throttler is used to allow things to happen at a slower rate
 * than than the parent update thread. It features a run method,
 * which returns whether or not enough time has passed to run something.
 * Alternatively, it features a waitAndRun method, which allows the
 * user to sleep until it is ready for the next thing.
 *
 * This class is useful as an alternative to creating additional
 * threads when appropriate. It does not create any threads so
 * there are no concurrency issues.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    Throttler throttler = new Throttler().setFrequency(5.0);
 *
 *    while (true)
 *    {
 *       if (throttler.run())
 *       {
 *          // do stuff
 *       }
 *    }
 * </pre>
