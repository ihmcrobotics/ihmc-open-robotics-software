# Coordinate convention: relative to the robot, +x is forward, +y is to the left, +z is up
# All length units are in meters.
#
# Wall format:
# - center is a 3-element array containing the (x,y,z) center of the wall relative to world
# - lengths is a 3-element array containing the x,y, and z dimensions of the wall,
#   more or less length, thickness and height
# - slopeRadians indicates the wall should be rotated about its center around the y axis
# - yawDegrees indicates the wall should be rotated about its center around the z axis
