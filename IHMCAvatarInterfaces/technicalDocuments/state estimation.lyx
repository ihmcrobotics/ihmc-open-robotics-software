\begin_layout Section
Introduction and overall estimator design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document describes the design of a novel state estimator for use in
 legged robots.
 The goal of the estimator is to determine the robot's position and orientation
 in the world, as well as its linear and angular velocity and linear and
 angular acceleration, given noisy measurements.
 Joint positions, velocities, and accelerations are assumed to be known
 or estimated separately, leaving only the task of localization with respect
 to the world to the presented estimator.
 Its design can be used with any number of angular velocity, linear acceleration
, and orientation sensors, attached to any link of the robot.
 In addition, any number of body-fixed point velocity measurements can be
 incorporated.
 This latter type of measurement can be used for example when it is known
 that certain points on the robot's feet are in nonslipping contact with
 the ground.
 The estimator also incorporates information about the desired accelerations
 of the robot's links, as supplied e.g.
 by an inverse-dynamics-based controller, which may give it an advantage
 over other estimation approaches used thus far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since our process model is nonlinear, a simple Kalman filter will not do.
 The main options for nonlinear process models are the extended Kalman filter,
 the unscented Kalman filter, and the particle filter.
 In the extended Kalman filter, the process model and measurement model
 are linearized about the current state estimate, and a regular (time-variant)
 Kalman filter is applied to the linearized model.
 In an unscented Kalman filter, a finite set of sample points are chosen
 and propagated through the nonlinear dynamics, from which the mean and
 covariance of the estimate are determined, to be used in the Kalman filter
 update equations.
 The particle filter is a fully nonlinear filter, that can be considered
 a statistical, brute-force approach to estimation that often works well
 for problems that are difficult for the conventional Kalman filter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 We have chosen to use the extended Kalman filter approach, because the
 dynamics are not highly nonlinear, and it has been shown that the performance
 of an unscented Kalman filter is about the same as that of an extended
 Kalman filter in this type of application 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Laviola2003"

\end_inset

, making the reduced computational load of the extended Kalman filter the
 tie breaker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have chosen to make the state vector as small as possible, and to have
 it represent the configuration, velocity, and acceleration of the robot
 in a consistent and unambiguous manner.
 The state vector consists of CoM position, velocity, and acceleration,
 orientation, angular velocity and angular acceleration of one of the robot's
 links, and bias estimates for each angular velocity sensor and each linear
 acceleration sensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the goal of the presented state estimator is to estimate the orientation
 of one of the robot's links.
 Hence, we need to decide on the parameterization of orientation we use.
 We have chosen to use a unit quaternion to parameterize the global orientation
 state estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presented estimator is largely based on the work presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bloesch2012"

\end_inset

.
 The main differences between their approach and ours are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
we treat IMU linear acceleration measurements as measurements, and not as
 inputs to the model.
 Instead, we incorporate accelerations into our state vector;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
we incorporate information concerning desired accelerations, as provided
 by our controller, into the estimator's process model;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
our estimator can handle any number of IMUs, whereas theirs can only handle
 one;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
we do not incorporate the position of contact points into our state vector,
 as this information is redundant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this document is structured as follows.
 In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Process-model"

\end_inset

, we derive the process model used in the extended Kalman filter.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Measurements"

\end_inset

 presents the measurement model.
 The appendices contain derivations used throughout the derivations in the
 two main sections.

\begin_layout Section
Process model
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discrete time extended Kalman filter requires a process model of the
 form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{n+1}=Fx_{n}+Gu_{n}+w_{n}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,Q\right)$
\end_inset

 is the process noise.
 The matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 vary from update to update.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of our process model will be more naturally described in continuous
 time.
 We will derive this continuous-time part of the process model in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Continuous-time-part"

\end_inset

.
 The continuous-time part of the process model will be nonlinear.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Linearized-error-model"

\end_inset

 derives a continuous-time linearized error model.
 This linearized continuous-time model will then be discretized in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Discretization"

\end_inset

 with a zero-order hold assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the continuous-time part, our process model will also incorporate
 a part that is more naturally described using a linear, discrete-time state
 space model.
 This part does not need to be linearized or discretized, and will simply
 be appended to the discretized version of the continuous time part of the
 process model to obtain the final model 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(F,G,Q\right)$
\end_inset

 used by the estimator.
 This part of the process model is described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Continuous time part of dynamics
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the part of the process model that is most naturally
 described in continuous time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use CoM position and velocity in our state vector.
 The motivations for this choice are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
we conjecture that the CoM on average has smaller variations in its acceleration
 than any fixed point on the robot, as the CoM is a mass-weighted average
 of the positions of the robot's link CoMs.
 Estimating a low bandwidth signal is easier than estimating a high bandwidth
 signal in the presence of a noisy process and noisy measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
since IMUs are presumed to be mounted to any number of different links,
 there is no compelling argument to make any link be special by putting
 its position and velocity in the state vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
force measurements could easily be incorporated if desired, since the sum
 of external forces is directly related to CoM acceleration.
 We have not yet incorporated a description of these measurements in this
 document however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, there is no angular equivalent of the CoM, so we need to
 pick an 
\emph on
orientation estimation link
\emph default
, i.e.
 a link for which the orientation and angular velocity will be part of the
 state vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, we will also estimate biases for the gyros and accelerometers,
 so these biases also need to be incorporated into the state vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the state vector for this part of the dynamics consists of the
 following entries:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

: CoM position in world frame;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{r}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 link with respect to the world frame;
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inputs to the continuous time part of the dynamics consist of desired
 accelerations computed by the controller.
 The input vector consists of
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\ddot{r}_{d}$
\end_inset

: desired CoM acceleration;
\end_layout

Linearized error model
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Linearized-error-model"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the linearization of the nonlinear process model
 presented in the previous section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only part of the continuous-time dynamics that is nonlinear is the kinematic
 equation describing how the unit quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 changes in time.
 In addition to this equation being nonlinear, a problem that arises with
 the use of unit quaternions is that the unit norm constraint needs to be
 preserved.
 The update steps in the Kalman filter itself do not know about this constraint
 and will in general not enforce it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple way to enforce this constraint is to convert differences with respect
 to the current estimate to a local, minimal description (i.e.
 using three numbers), compute a correction in terms of this minimal description
, convert the correction back to a quaternion, and then perform quaternion
 multiplication to correct the estimate.
 We will use a local description in terms of an error rotation vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\phi}{\left\Vert \phi\right\Vert }$
\end_inset

 is the axis of rotation, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \phi\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 is the rotation angle about the axis of rotation.
 This approach was introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pittelkau2003"

\end_inset

, and also applied in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bloesch2012"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equation describing the rotational kinematics in terms of the rotation
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is derived in the appendix (section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Appendix:-rotation-vector"

\end_inset

), and reads
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\phi}=\omega+\frac{\phi\times\omega}{2}+\underbrace{\frac{1}{\left\Vert \phi\right\Vert ^{2}}\left[1-\frac{\left\Vert \phi\right\Vert \sin\left\Vert \phi\right\Vert }{2\left(1-\cos\left\Vert \phi\right\Vert \right)}\right]\phi\times\left(\phi\times\omega\right)}_{c}\label{eq:bortz}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Note the singularity at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \phi\right\Vert =n2\pi$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{Z}\backslash0$
\end_inset

, which is the reason for only using these dynamics locally around the current
 orientation estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we derive a linearization of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:bortz"

\end_inset

, written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\phi}\approx\frac{\partial\dot{\phi}}{\partial\phi}\phi+\frac{\partial\dot{\phi}}{\partial\omega}\omega
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The derivative with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\dot{\phi}}{\partial\phi}=-\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\omega}+\frac{\partial c}{\partial\phi}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}\in so\left(3\right)$
\end_inset

 represents the skew-symmetric matrix such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}y=x\times y$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The derivative with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\dot{\phi}}{\partial\omega}=I+\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\phi}+\frac{\partial c}{\partial\omega}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we linearize around 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0$
\end_inset

, we can simplify these derivatives.
 Using Mathematica, we have shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\phi\rightarrow0}\frac{\partial c}{\partial\phi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\phi\rightarrow0}\frac{\partial c}{\partial\omega}$
\end_inset

 exist and are zero.
 Furthermore, the term in the expression for 
\family roman

 that is linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\phi}$
\end_inset

 also disappears due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 being assumed negligably small, finally resulting in the linearized rotation
 vector kinematics
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\phi}\approx I\omega-\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\omega}\phi
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use this as our process model for orientation, we need to be able to
 convert a corrective term 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi$
\end_inset

, obtained in the correction step of the Kalman filter based on this model,
 to the global description in terms of quaternions.
 This is done using the conversion
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta q=\zeta\left(\Delta\phi\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta:k\mapsto\zeta\left(k\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\left\Vert k\right\Vert \frac{k}{\left\Vert k\right\Vert }\right)\\
\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\left\Vert k\right\Vert \right)
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset

so that the correction equation for orientation becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{q}_{n+1}^{+}=\hat{q}_{n+1}^{-}\otimes\Delta q
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The propagation equation is simply
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{q}_{n+1}^{-}=\hat{q}_{n}^{+}\otimes\zeta\left(\hat{\omega}\Delta t\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now construct the continuous-time state space model describing the
 error dynamics:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{x}^{c}=Ax^{c}+Bu+w^{c}
\]

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
x^{c} & =\left(r,\dot{r},\phi,\omega,b_{\dot{v},1},\dotsc,b_{a,n},b_{\dot{v},1},\dotsc,b_{\omega,n}\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\\
u & =\left(\ddot{r}_{d},\dot{\omega}_{d}\right)\\
w^{c} & =\left(0,w_{\ddot{r}},0,w_{\dot{\omega}},w_{b_{\dot{v},1}},\dotsc,w_{b_{\dot{v},n}},w_{b_{\omega,1}},\dotsc,w_{b_{\omega,n}}\right)\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,Q^{c}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we have defined the dimension 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\end_inset

with the number of bias estimate entries defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 the number of linear acceleration measurements.

Note that the Matlab documentation for the `kalmd' function additionally
 states that the measurement noise covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 should become 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\Delta t}R$
\end_inset

 when the model is discretized.
 We think this assumes that the measurement in the discretized model is
 the average of a continuous stream of measurements taken throughout the
 discretization time step, thereby averaging out the zero-mean noise and
 resulting in a reduced noise covariance with increased measurement time.
 We think this is not a good assumption, and instead assume that the original
 continuous-time measurement noise is just sampled once per discretization
 time step, resulting in an unaltered covariance.

 Although two matrix exponentials are required in this alternative approach,
 the arguments of the matrix exponential have smaller dimensions in both
 cases.
 Since approximating the exponential of an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix usually requires a fixed number of 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix products, which have complexity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{3}\right)$
\end_inset

 using a schoolbook matrix multiplication method, this alternative approach
 may be more efficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix exponential can be approximated in a number of ways, such as
 using a truncated version of the power series definition or using a Padé
 approximant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The Padé approximant method is generally considered much more numerically
 stable than using the power series definition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, so we have implemented this approach.

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we note that it is unnecessary to discretize the entire continuous-time
 state space model as a whole every time step.
 Since the CoM dynamics, the orientation estimation link dynamics, and the
 bias dynamics are all completely independent of eachother (i.e.
 they don't share any states or inputs), their process models can also be
 discretized independently, resulting in even smaller dimensions of the
 matrices that need to be exponentiated.
 Furthermore, since only the orientation estimation link dynamics are time-varia
nt, this is is the only part of the dynamics that requires discretization
 at every timestep; the other parts of the dynamics need only be discretized
 once at startup.
 This reduces the computational load for discretization to either a single
 
\begin_inset Formula $15\times15$
\end_inset

 matrix exponential, or alternatively one 
\begin_inset Formula $9\times9$
\end_inset

 and one 
\begin_inset Formula $12\times12$
\end_inset

 matrix exponential per time step.

In the extended Kalman filter framework, measurements can only refer to
 states, not to inputs.
 Since the accelerometers in the IMUs will provide measurements of the linear
 acceleration, we need to have accelerations as part of the state vector.
 In addition, a difference between the input accelerations and the estimated
 accelerations, which also take the linear acceleration measurements into
 account, may be useful in control, e.g.
 to estimate the magnitude of unmodeled external forces applied to the robot.

Orientation sensor

\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}^{w}$
\end_inset

, describing the orientation of measurement frame 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 with respect to the world 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

.
 This rotation matrix can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{i}^{w}=R_{p}^{w}R_{i}^{p}
\]

\end_inset

i.e.
 the measured quaternion is a function of the orientation of the orientation
 estimation frame 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 with respect to the world 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, and of the joint angles of the joints between frames 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Postmultiplying a noise rotation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{v}$
\end_inset

, we obtain our measurement model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z_{R,i}=R_{p}^{w}R_{i}^{p}R_{v}
\]

\end_inset

Note that the noise rotation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{v}$
\end_inset

 has to satisfy the constraint that it is orthonormal.
 It is therefore not the case that each of the elements of this noise rotation
 matrix has an independent Gaussian distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The estimated orientation of the orientation estimation link can be written
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{R}_{p}^{w}=R_{p}^{w}R_{\phi}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\phi}$
\end_inset

 is the rotation matrix associated with the estimation error rotation vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The predicted measurement can be hence written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{z}_{R,i}=\hat{R}_{p}^{w}R_{i}^{p}=R_{p}^{w}R_{\phi}R_{i}^{p}
\]

\end_inset

so that the measurement residual can be written in rotation matrix form
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
y_{R,i} & =\hat{z}_{R,i}^{-1}z_{R,i}\\
 & =R_{p}^{i}R_{\phi}^{-1}R_{w}^{p}R_{p}^{w}R_{i}^{p}R_{v}\\
 & =R_{p}^{i}R_{\phi}^{-1}R_{i}^{p}R_{v}
\end{align*}

 For small

\begin_inset Formula $I-\widetilde{R_{p}^{i}\phi}$
\end_inset

 can be identified with the rotation vector 
\begin_inset Formula $-R_{p}^{i}\phi$
\end_inset

.
 It is in terms of this rotation vector form that we model the noise on
 the measurement (and hence the residual) as Gaussian, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
y_{\phi,i} & =-R_{p}^{i}\phi+v_{\phi}\\
v_{\phi} & \sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,Q_{\phi}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
We can finally rewrite this rotation vector measurement residual in the
 canonical form
\begin_inset Formula

Note also that if the joint angle measurements that are needed to find

\begin_layout Standard
The configuration of a frame 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 with respect to a frame 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 can be described using the homogeneous transformation matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{j}^{i}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
R_{j}^{i} & p_{j}^{i}\\
0_{1\times3} & 1

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{j}^{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 represents the orientation of frame 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 with respect to frame 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 using a rotation matrix whose columns are the unit vectors of frame 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 expressed in 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}^{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the position of the origin of frame 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, expressed in frame 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 The representation of configuration using a homogeneous transform is highly
 redundant, but has the advantage that it is globally valid.
 There is no three number parameterization of rotation that has no singularities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The homogeneous transformation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{j}^{i}$

\begin_layout Standard
We start by the usual derivation of angular velocity.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{j}^{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 be a time-variant rotation matrix.
 Its derivative, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{R}_{j}^{i}\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

, is constrained by the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{j}^{i}$
\end_inset

 must be a rotation matrix at all times.
 We can exploit the orthogonality property by noting that since 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}=I$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left(R_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}\right)=\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}+R_{j}^{i}\dot{R}_{i}^{j}=0
\]

\end_inset

and since 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}=\left(R_{j}^{i}\dot{R}_{i}^{j}\right)^{T}$
\end_inset

, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}=-\left(\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}\right)^{T}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

 is a skew-symmetric matrix, and can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -a_{z} & a_{y}\\
a_{z} & 0 & -a_{x}\\
-a_{y} & a_{x} & 0
\end{array}\right)=:\tilde{a},\quad\text{for }a=\left(\begin{array}{c}
a_{x}\\
a_{y}\\
a_{z}
\end{array}\right)\label{eq:skew-symmetric}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the angular velocity expressed in the base frame 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 (also called the instantaneous spatial angular velocity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Murray1994"

\end_inset

), and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}$
\end_inset

 can be called the angular velocity in tilde form 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 Switching back and forth between tilde form and 3D vector form is an important
 operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This angular velocity vector 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 may be rotated to any other frame 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 using
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b=R_{i}^{k}a
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we note a special property concerning rotation matrices and skew-symmetric
 matrices.
 For any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\tilde{b}x & =\widetilde{R_{i}^{k}a}x\\
 & =\left(R_{i}^{k}a\right)\times x\\
 & =R_{i}^{k}R_{k}^{i}\left(\left(R_{i}^{k}a\right)\times x\right)\\
 & =R_{i}^{k}\left(R_{k}^{i}\left(R_{i}^{k}a\right)\times\left(R_{k}^{i}x\right)\right)\\
 & =R_{i}^{k}\left(a\times\left(R_{k}^{i}x\right)\right)\\
 & =R_{i}^{k}\tilde{a}R_{k}^{i}x
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since this result must hold for all vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

, we must have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{b}=\widetilde{R_{i}^{k}a}=R_{i}^{k}\tilde{a}R_{k}^{i}\label{eq:tilde-rotation-property}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Substituting 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\tilde{b} & =R_{i}^{k}\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{i}^{j}R_{k}^{i}\\
 & =R_{i}^{k}\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{k}^{j}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation gives us a way of changing the frame of an angular velocity
 when it is expressed in tilde form.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 denotes the angular velocity of the body frame 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, with respect to base frame 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, expressed in (i.e.
 rotated to) frame 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, we introduce the very explicit notation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\omega}_{j}^{k,i}:=R_{i}^{k}\dot{R}_{j}^{i}R_{k}^{j}\label{eq:angular-velocity}

 the first superscript denotes the frame in which the angular velocity is

 because they are attached to the same rigid body), we have

 We can solve for the linear velocity of the estimation link:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v_{p}^{p,w}=R_{w}^{p}\dot{r}-\tilde{\omega}r^{p}-\dot{r}^{p}\label{eq:rootjoint-linear-vel}

To find the linear acceleration of the estimation link, we differentiate
 this equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\dot{v}_{p}^{p,w} & =R_{w}^{p}\ddot{r}+\dot{R}_{w}^{p}\dot{r}-\tilde{\dot{\omega}}r^{p}-\tilde{\omega}\dot{r}^{p}-\ddot{r}^{p}\nonumber \\

Appendix: computing the Jacobian of a cross product with respect to a vector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 each be dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 We can exploit the bilinear property of the cross product to find the Jacobian
 of the cross product of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 This Jacobian can be written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}\left(x\times y\right)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x\times y\right)\frac{\partial x}{\partial\alpha}+\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\times y\right)\frac{\partial y}{\partial\alpha}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we note that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x\times y=\tilde{x}y
\]

\end_inset

so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(x\times y\right)=\tilde{x}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note also that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x\times y=-y\times x=-\tilde{y}x
\]

\end_inset

so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(x\times y\right)=-\tilde{y}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Jacobian can hence be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}\left(x\times y\right)=\tilde{x}\frac{\partial y}{\partial\alpha}-\tilde{y}\frac{\partial x}{\partial\alpha}\label{eq:cross-product-jacobian}
\end{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$

 The Jacobi identity states that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a\times\left(b\times c\right)+c\times\left(a\times b\right)+b\times\left(c\times a\right)=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This can also be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(a\times b\right)\times c=a\times\left(b\times c\right)-b\times\left(a\times c\right)
\]

\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widetilde{\tilde{a}b}c=\tilde{a}\tilde{b}c-\tilde{b}\tilde{a}c
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since this must hold for all vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\tilde{a}b}=\tilde{a}\tilde{b}-\tilde{b}\tilde{a}\label{eq:jacobi-identity-tilde}
